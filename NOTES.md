> The sample budgets below represent average costs for the 2020-2021 academic year, or what is often referred to as the cost of attendance. These budgets are based on 15 credits/semester for undergraduate students and 9 credits/semester for graduate students.

> Room and board costs in the budget include a double room, linen service, Silver meal plan and use of study, laundry and recreational facilities. Students are allotted the same amount for living costs (room and board) whether they live on- or off-campus.

> Personal and miscellaneous costs include average amounts for clothing, transportation, personal care, cell phone, recreation, etc.

> Please note that there is no allowance in the undergraduate budget for car expenses.
